# Task 1: Understand Requirements and Create Detailed Tasks

Objective: read `requirements.md` and produce concrete task files.

Steps
1) Parse requirements: system name/dir, protocols (packages, models, services), microservices (modules, DB, logic, config, handlers, tests), docker-compose, integration tests.
2) Create detailed `tasks/02-scaffolding.md` with exact dirs, clone/rename commands, git init, verification commands.
3) Create detailed `tasks/03-protocols.md` with full proto contents, buf config, generation commands, git steps.
4) Create detailed `tasks/04-microservices.md` per service: configs to edit, modules to keep/remove, models, repo methods, service logic, handlers, conversions, migrations, swagger updates, tests, build commands.
5) Create detailed `tasks/05-docker-compose.md` with service definitions, env, health checks, networks/volumes, verification commands.
6) Create detailed `tasks/06-integration-tests.md` with scenarios, setup/teardown, scripts/commands, expected results.

Checkpoint: STOP after tasks are written. Present tasks for user approval before any execution.
